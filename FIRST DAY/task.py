# """ Printing Practice
# Write a program that uses print statements to print the following recipe into the Output console. 
# The text to print is already there, you just need to make it into code. 
# Your code should print all five lines exactly the same as the example output below. 
# Make sure that you don't change any of these existing text as everything, punctuation and casing all need to match!
# 1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.
# 2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.
# 3. Add 3g of Salt.
# 4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.
# 5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.


# NOTES: 
# "(\n) - New line character. 
# "(+) - Concatentation.
# "input() - Accept user input"
# "len()" - Length
